# Assignment 3
**Interrupt hackathon!**

This weeks assignment is more about finding out how everything works by yourself and along with your peers. Therefore, this time we'll be working in groups of about 3 people. 

This week you've learned about interrupts and RTIC, and as you can guess, the assignment revolves around these concepts. Now that we know how to write concurrent applications, there are loads of awesome projects you can think of. Of course, you can write another game, like snake, two-player pong, or even a platformer. You could also use the interrupt functionality of the LIS3DH. You could create cool LED sequences with libraries crates like `blinq`. 

The hackathon rules:
- HD and one more person (TBD) are the judge
- Upload your code into a git repository, add instructions on how to flash and run the project
- Use the channel chat to ask each other for help if you are stuck.
- No busy waiting code in your application. Use interrupts.
- Bonus points if you use RTIC.
- Use only the nrf52840dk, the ssd1306 display, and the lis3dh accelerometer.
- You have until june 17 2021, 17:00 PM to send in your project, by sending an email to henkdieter@tweedegolf.com, containing the link to your repository.

*Don't be afraid to share your ideas with other teams. After all, we're here to have fun and learn!*
